                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe it was in an old blog post on A Suitable Wardrobe where I came across a Bruce Boyer
                    quote, and I paraphrase, that a well-curated wardrobe is the best incentive to stay in shape. By
                    "stay in shape," he meant staying the same size, of course. If you've invested a considerable amount
                    into clothes that hang without a pull or a ripple, you probably don't want to gain or lose too much
                    weight, either way.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "A well-curated wardrobe is the best incentive to stay in shape."

                <h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
                <p>
                    That quote in the introduction recently came to mind as I started rebuilding my shirt wardrobe. I
                    had a moment of realization last year, much like when Daisy buried her face into Gatsby's collection
                    of sheer linen and fine flannel shirts, sobbing, "They're such beautiful
                    shirts." Except, mine weren't so beautiful. They were so slim. Things I bought fifteen years ago
                    no longer fit, as I've gone up a size. Unlike tailored jackets, button-ups don't come with inlays,
                    so I've been slowly rebuilding my shirt collection, piece by piece.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The tattersalls I thought would go nicely under rustic tweed jackets barely saw any use over
                        the past fifteen years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The discounted Margiela shirt I bought as an experiment looked more like a bad Kickstarter
                        project than thoughtful avant-garde.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This guide will be broken into two parts: shirts for tailoring and shirts for casualwear.
                    </li>
                    <li>Like my "Excited to Wear" posts, this is filled with personal prejudice and bias.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Oxford Cloth Button-Down</h2>
                <p>
                    Nearly 20 years after buying my first one, the oxford cloth button-down remains the backbone of
                    my tailored wardrobe. I love it for all the reasons why I love the other hallmarks of classic
                    American style: three-roll-two jackets, polo coats, duffle coats,
                    round-toe Aldens, prickly Shetlands, and turned-up cuffs sitting on top of penny loafers. This
                    casual variant of classic British clothing is more democratic, a reflection of American values, and
                    feels at home in today's dressed-down world.
                </p>
                <h3>The History</h3>
                <p>
                    As the story goes, the button-down collar came about in 1896 when John E. Brooks, grandson of
                    Brooks Brothers founder Henry Sands Brooks, noticed English polo players wearing little buttons on
                    their
                    collars to prevent the points from flapping in their faces
                    during play. He thought this invention was charming, so he sent a sample to his tailors with
                    instructions to copy it. In 1900, Brooks Brothers put the new design on their ready-made sport
                    shirts, first marketed as "polo shirts" for their polo-inspired collars.
                </p>
                <h3>Origins and Style</h3>
                <p>
                    Originally debuted in white cotton cheviots (a stout twill), these shirts were later made in a
                    nubby basketweave known as oxford. Hence the name: oxford cloth button-downs. Since Brooks Brothers
                    dressed that upwardly mobile class of Americans who saw
                    their fortunes rise with industrial capitalism, their shirts were worn by the kind of people who
                    sent their children to elite preparatory schools that fed into the Ivy League system.
                </p>
                <h3>Essential Qualities</h3>
                <p>
                    That's how these shirts became part of the language of Ivy Style, worn with soft-shouldered
                    tweeds, rep striped ties, flat-front trousers, and tassel loafers. For men who measure the distance
                    between the buttons on their two-button Ivy Style jacket cuffs,
                    there are two crucial qualities when shopping for a button-down. First, the collar should be
                    free of the fused interlining typically used to make the collar behave but robs it of the individual
                    expression, casual ease, and lived-in look that made the mid-century Brooks Brothers shirts
                    charming.

                    <p>
                        A well-made button-down can last 5-10 years with proper care. The collar and cuffs wear
                        first, so inspect them regularly. If they show excessive fraying or the collar points no longer
                        maintain their shape, it's time for replacement.

                <h2>The Not-Quite-White Shirt</h2>
                <p>
                    In his book The Suit, conservative essayist Michael Anton suggested adding colored shirts to the
                    standard white and light blue wardrobe staples. His top pick was pink, followed by yellow,
                    lavender, and the rare sage green. Much like his recommendations
                    for balmoral boots and BlazerSuits, which I tried and ultimately found to be costly, misguided
                    experiments, the pastel-colored shirts I've accumulated over the years have mainly gone unworn.
                    They've always felt too dandy, working better as stripes, where white lines mute the candy color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, I've found that ecru fulfills the promise other colors aspire to but rarely deliver. In
                    a world where most men are free from the cavils of propriety, an ecru shirt can be worn with dark
                    worsted business suits, but won't look incomplete without neckwear. Contrast this with a stark white
                    shirt, which can feel as barren as a night sky without stars when worn tieless.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Building a shirt wardrobe is a journey of self-discovery. What begins as a practical response to
                    changing body measurements evolves into a deeper appreciation for craftsmanship, history, and
                    personal style. The oxford cloth button-down remains my foundation, but ecru has become my secret
                    weapon for versatility.

                <p>
                    This guide represents just the first part of the wardrobe equation. In the next installment,
                    we'll explore shirts for casualwear, chinos, denim, and everything in between. Until then, I
                    encourage you to examine your current collection with fresh eyes. What serves you well? What
                    deserves retirement? Your wardrobe should be a source of confidence, not constraint.
